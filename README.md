ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Hani Alija, a passionate beginner in the world of web development, exploring the endless possibilities of coding. With a hunger for learning and a knack for problem-solving, I'm diving headfirst into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft captivating and user-friendly websites.

ðŸŒ± My journey into the realm of coding began with a curiosity that quickly turned into a full-blown fascination. Every line of code I write is a step forward in my quest to master the art of web development. Whether I'm tinkering with responsive designs or delving into the intricacies of backend development, I approach each challenge with enthusiasm and determination.

ðŸ’» With experience in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and a dash of React, I'm constantly expanding my toolkit to create dynamic and engaging web experiences. Additionally, I've dabbled in C# .NET, PHP Laravel, and Java Springboot, broadening my horizons and exploring the diverse landscape of software development.

ðŸŽ“ Currently, I'm a CS student in my third year at South East European University, consistently maintaining high grades above 9. I'm eagerly seeking potential internships to further enhance my skills and gain real-world experience in the field.

ðŸš€ As I continue to grow and evolve as a developer, I'm eager to contribute to open-source projects, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and push the boundaries of what's possible with code. Let's connect, collaborate, and code the future together! ðŸ’»âœ¨

Feel free to connect with me on GitHub and explore my journey in coding! ðŸŒŸ (https://github.com/HaniAlija49) ðŸš€
